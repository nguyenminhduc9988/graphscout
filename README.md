One `build` per repo; after that, every query auto-refreshes only the files that changed since the last call (mtime-based). No forced background process, no external database, no API keys — a JSON cache under `~/.cache/graphscout`, plus an in-memory SQLite FTS5 index built on demand for search. Want it always fresh with zero per-query overhead instead? Run `graphscout watch`.

## 🆕 New in 0.6.1

`routes` now detects the same 17 named framework families as codegraph's
published list, up from 9: added Play, Drupal (`*.routing.yml` + `hook_*` in
`.module`/`.theme`/`.install`/`.inc`), Vapor, Axum, React Router, SvelteKit,
Vue Router/Nuxt, and Astro; split the old combined "express/gin" label into
`express` and `gin/chi/gorilla/mux` (plus gorilla's `HandleFunc` shape), and
folded Rocket into the existing actix attribute-macro pattern (identical
`#[get("/x")]` shape, matching codegraph's own Axum/actix/Rocket grouping).
File-based routers (SvelteKit/Vue-Nuxt/Astro) resolve the route straight from
the file's path — no line to point at, so those rows show `:1`.

## 🆕 New in 0.6.0

Six more graph-backed capabilities — answers neither codegraph gives, each built
on data graphscout already extracts instead of a fresh pass:

- **`metrics [query]`** — per-symbol complexity cards: **fan-in** (how many sites
  call it — load-bearing), **fan-out** (how many distinct callees — a complexity
  proxy), reference/type edges in & out, and inferred body lines. With a name,
  one symbol's card; without, the repo ranked two ways — top fan-out
  (likely-too-big functions) and top fan-in (hubs many callers depend on).
- **`dupes`** — copy-paste / near-identical function bodies across files. Bodies
  are normalized (comments, whitespace, case stripped; the declaration line
  dropped so two functions with identical bodies but different names still
  cluster). A call graph can't see this at all — two identical helpers have no
  edge between them.
- **`recent`** — symbols in files touched by the last N commits. Lighter than
  `diff` (two explicit refs): this is the churn-window "what's been moving
  lately" view for orienting on a repo.
- **`why <a> <b>`** — shortest call chain from one symbol to another over
  resolved call edges. The two-symbol "why does A depend on B" question that
  `impact` (undirected blast radius from one seed) doesn't directly answer.
- **`tokens <name>`** — token cost of one symbol's body: "is it worth reading
  the whole thing, or take the outline first?" The single most on-brand metric
  for a tool whose purpose is to stop agents reading whole files. tiktoken
  (cl100k) when installed, else a chars/4 heuristic within ~15%.
- **`viz --kind=imports`** — the existing call-graph viz now also draws the
  **file-level module dependency graph** (the shape `cycles`/`affected`/`rdeps`
  operate on), as Mermaid or Graphviz DOT.
- `doctor` gains a **tiktoken** capability check, and all six new commands ship
  with `--json` output and matching MCP tools.

## 🆕 New in 0.5.0

Beyond the one-call `explore`, graphscout now answers questions the underlying
graph never used to surface directly:

- **`diff <ref> [ref2]`** — symbol-level added/removed/modified defs between
  two git refs (or a ref and the working tree) — a code-review-shaped view a
  line diff can't give: a signature-only rename shows as one changed symbol,
  not a hunk of `-`/`+` lines.
- **`orphans`** — dead-code candidates: symbols with no in-repo caller, after
  filtering entrypoints, tests, and decorated handlers, *and* cross-checking
  plain text for the call styles graphify's edges don't capture (see below).
- **`hotspots`** — refactor-priority ranking: files that are both frequently
  changed (git churn) and structurally central (graph connectivity) — Adam
  Tornhill's "hotspot" idea, computed from data graphscout already has.
- **`routes`** — API surface in one call: Flask/FastAPI/Django/Express/Gin/
  NestJS/Spring/ASP.NET/Actix/Rails/Laravel route detection.
- **`doctor`** — one command answering "why didn't search rank anything" or
  "why is watch just polling": FTS5, git, the mcp/watchdog extras, and this
  repo's graph health, all in one place.
- **`daemon start|stop|status`** — the same sync loop as `watch`, detached
  into the background with a pidfile, instead of blocking a terminal.
- **`roots`** — every repo graphscout has ever indexed, with size and
  freshness, so an agent can check before re-running `build`.
- **`--json`** on every query command — structured output for scripts/CI,
  the formatted text stays the default for agents.
- **92 indexable extensions**, sourced live from graphify's own detector
  instead of a hand-copied list — grows automatically as graphify adds
  languages, no graphscout release required.

## 🎯 The one idea: blast radius in one call

The single most expensive question an agent asks is *"what breaks if I change this?"* — normally answered by reading file after file. `graphscout impact` walks the call graph both directions and hands back the **whole** affected set, ranked by depth:

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/blast.svg" alt="Animated blast-radius ripple — change one symbol, see everything it touches at depth 1 and depth 2" width="900"/>
</div>

```bash
graphscout impact parse_config --depth=2      # what breaks if I change this?
git diff --name-only | graphscout affected --stdin   # which tests does my diff touch?
```

No dynamic-dispatch guesswork dressed up as certainty — edges come from static AST analysis, and the honest limits are printed right in the output when they apply.

## 📦 Install

```bash
pip install graphscout          # CLI
pip install "graphscout[mcp]"   # CLI + MCP server
pip install "graphscout[watch]" # CLI + instant filesystem-event auto-sync
```

Python ≥ 3.10. Parsing is done by [graphify](https://pypi.org/project/graphifyy/) (tree-sitter).

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/langs.svg" alt="Language coverage — 13 with full def/call/import extraction, 40+ more with outline structure" width="900"/>
</div>

**Language coverage is measured, not asserted.** `graphscout`'s indexable extension set
(`core.CODE_EXTS`) is now sourced *live* from graphify's own detector rather than a
hand-copied list, so it tracks whatever graphify supports — currently **92 extensions**.
`python scripts/lang_coverage.py` builds a real two-file sample per language and checks
whether a `calls` edge crosses the file boundary — the same bar full extraction implies.
Reproducible, not a marketing number:

```
16/20 sampled languages resolve cross-file calls:
  c, cpp, csharp, go, groovy, java, javascript, kotlin, php,
  powershell, python, ruby, rust, swift, typescript, vue
same-file only: (none in this sample)
no call edges at all: dart, elixir, lua, scala
```

That's a sample, not an exhaustive audit of all 92 extensions — treat it as a lower
bound, and re-run the script yourself against languages you care about.

## ✨ What you get

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🔎 `explore` — one call, not four
Verbatim source + callers/callees + multi-hop blast radius for the top-matching symbols. The shape an agent actually needs, instead of chaining `sym → file → callers → Read`.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🧠 Ranked full-text search
In-memory SQLite FTS5 (bm25, prefix, multi-term) — not a plain substring scan — and docstring nodes are excluded so real symbols aren't drowned out by prose.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 💥 Multi-hop impact analysis
Bidirectional BFS over the call graph, depth-bounded — the *actual* blast radius of a change, not a one-hop callers/callees guess.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🧪 Test-impact from a diff
`git diff --name-only \| graphscout affected --stdin` — which tests does this change touch, traced through resolved imports.

<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🙈 `.gitignore`-aware indexing
Routes through `git ls-files --exclude-standard` — nested `.gitignore`s and the global excludes file honored exactly as git sees them. Hard-coded skips (`node_modules`, `dist`, …) apply regardless.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### ⚡ Incremental, mtime-based cache
One `build` per repo; every query re-extracts only what changed. No database server, no daemon required — `graphscout watch` is opt-in.

<td width="50%" valign="top">

### ⚙️ `exclude` / `include` / `extensions`
Optional `graphscout.json` — force a vendored path back in, drop noisy generated code, or map a non-standard suffix onto a supported language.

### 🔌 CLI *and* MCP
Same queries either way — shell out from any agent, or wire the MCP server into Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, and Windsurf with one command.

</td>

<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🔬 Symbol-level `diff`
`graphscout diff HEAD~5` — added/removed/modified **functions**, not line hunks. A rename shows as one changed symbol.

No in-repo caller, after excluding entrypoints/tests/decorated handlers *and* a text cross-check for call styles the graph misses.

Files that are both frequently changed and structurally central — refactor priority, not just a line-count guess.

Every query command takes `--json` for scripts/CI; plain text stays the agent-facing default.

### 📊 `metrics` — complexity from the graph
Fan-in (load-bearing hubs), fan-out (complexity proxy), reference coupling, body lines — per symbol, or the whole repo ranked. Signals a call list alone can't give.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🧬 `dupes` — copy-paste across files
Near-identical function bodies (normalized: comments/whitespace/case stripped, declaration dropped). A clone a call graph is blind to — two identical helpers share no edge.

```

</details>

Every query calls `ensure` first — files whose mtime changed are re-extracted and spliced into the graph; deleted files drop out. Typical refresh touches a handful of files, so queries stay fast. Output is deliberately plain text with `file:line` locations — clickable in most agent UIs, trivially parseable by the rest. Set `GRAPHSCOUT_CACHE` to relocate the cache (useful in CI and sandboxes).

## 🤖 Integrate with any agent

`graphscout` is plain CLI-over-stdout, so **any agent that can run shell commands can use it** — Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, Aider, OpenHands, Goose, custom agents.

**1. Tell the agent the graph exists:**

```bash
graphscout agent >> AGENTS.md      # or CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, .github/copilot-instructions.md
```

**2. (Optional) Keep the graph fresh on every edit.** For Claude Code, install the bundled PostToolUse hook so each `Edit`/`Write` re-extracts just that file:

```bash
cp integrations/claude-code/graphscout-touch.sh ~/.claude/hooks/
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/graphscout-touch.sh
# then merge integrations/claude-code/settings-snippet.json into ~/.claude/settings.json
```

Even without a hook, queries stay correct — every query runs an mtime check first and re-extracts anything stale.

### 🔌 MCP, wired automatically

```bash
pip install "graphscout[mcp]"
graphscout install            # auto-detects and wires every agent found on PATH
graphscout install cursor     # or target specific agents: claude-code, codex, gemini, cursor, windsurf
graphscout uninstall          # reverse it
```

`install` shells out to each agent's own `mcp add` command where one exists (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI — verified against their real CLIs, not guessed), and edits `~/.cursor/mcp.json` / `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` directly for Cursor/Windsurf. Idempotent — safe to re-run.

Tools exposed: `explore` (lead with this), `search`, `impact`, `affected`, `symbol_diff`, `routes`, `orphans`, `hotspots`, `list_roots`, `doctor`, `build_graph`, `graph_map`, `file_outline`, `find_symbol`, `callers`, `callees`, `file_deps`. The server's `instructions` steer the agent to `explore` first — one strong tool beats a menu of narrow ones.

### 🔄 Auto-sync (optional)

```bash
graphscout watch                 # blocks, keeps the graph in sync as you/your agent edit files
graphscout daemon start          # same loop, detached — survives closing the terminal
graphscout daemon status         # is it running? pid + log location
graphscout daemon stop           # stop it
```

Uses [watchdog](https://pypi.org/project/watchdog/) for instant, low-CPU filesystem events when installed; falls back to a ~1.5s mtime poll otherwise. `daemon` wraps the same loop in a detached subprocess with a pidfile (pure Python — no bundled runtime, no OS service manager integration needed). Run one sync mechanism at a time — `watch`, `daemon`, or the per-edit `touch` hook, not several together.

## 🙈 Excludes, includes, custom extensions

Zero-config by default. Hard-coded skips (`.git`, `node_modules`, `venv`/`.venv`, `dist`, `build`, `target`, `vendor`, …) always apply, regardless of `.gitignore`. In a git repo, `.gitignore` is also honored via `git ls-files --exclude-standard` — nested `.gitignore`s and the global excludes file included, exactly as git itself sees them.

To go further, drop a `graphscout.json` at the repo root:

```json
{
  "exclude": ["static/", "**/generated/**"],
  "include": ["third_party/vendored_dep/"],
  "extensions": {".tpl": "php"}
}
```

`exclude` wins over everything, including `include`; `include` pulls a `.gitignore`d path back in but can't override the hard skip list. `extensions` maps a non-standard suffix onto a language graphify already parses.

## 📊 Benchmark

`python scripts/benchmark.py <repo>` compares the old `sym`+`file`+`callers`+`callees` workflow (4 calls, no verbatim source — a `Read` would still follow) against `explore` (1 call, source included), on real symbols picked from the target repo's own call graph. **Not a live-agent trial** — a reproducible, offline proxy anyone can re-run:

| Repo | Old calls → new | Old payload → new |
|---|---|---|
| this repo (235 nodes) | 20 → 5 (**75% fewer**) | 13,954 → 13,137 chars |
| [pallets/click](https://github.com/pallets/click) (1,803 nodes) | 20 → 5 (**75% fewer**) | 48,813 → 10,205 chars |

Call-count savings are structural (4 calls collapse to 1 regardless of repo size); payload savings vary with how verbose the old path's raw listings are versus one focused snippet.

<details>
<summary><b>⚠️ Honest limitations</b> (also printed in the output when they apply)</summary>

<br/>

- **Dynamic dispatch isn't captured** — call edges come from static AST analysis; `getattr`-style calls need grep.
- **Qualified module calls can be invisible to the graph** — `from mod import fn; fn()` resolves; the equally common `import mod; mod.fn()` idiom only produces an `imports` edge on the module, not a `calls` edge on the function (a graphify limitation, not graphscout's). `orphans` cross-checks plain text for exactly this reason; `callers`/`callees`/`impact` don't, so they can undercount on codebases written in that style.
- **Unsupported/exotic languages** fall back to "read it directly".
- **`affected` under-detects on multi-name absolute imports** — `from pkg import a, b` resolves to one edge on the package, not per-name. Relative imports and single-name absolute imports resolve fully.
- **No line ranges from the extractor** — graphify records a start line per symbol, not start+end; `explore`'s snippet end is inferred as "the line before the next symbol in the same file" (capped at 60 lines).
- **`routes` is a regex heuristic**, not a semantic one — it can match a route-shaped string inside a comment or docstring, and misses routes registered through a data-driven table or a runtime-computed decorator.
- **`orphans`/`hotspots` are heuristics, not certainties** — verify before deleting "dead" code (dynamic dispatch, reflection, and external callers of a published library all look unreferenced to a static graph) or over-indexing on a "hotspot" file that's just churn-heavy for a boring reason (a config file, a changelog).
- **Caps:** 5,000 files per repo, 1 MB per file (warned, not silent); blast-radius/impact traversal stops at 400 nodes (flagged `(truncated)`).

**Framework route detection**, closed in 0.6.1: graphscout now detects the same
17 named framework families codegraph lists — Django, Flask, FastAPI, Express,
NestJS, Laravel, Drupal, Rails, Spring, Play, Gin/chi/gorilla/mux, Axum/actix/
Rocket, ASP.NET, Vapor, React Router, SvelteKit, Vue Router/Nuxt, and Astro.
Named-family parity, not necessarily per-shape parity — codegraph documents
finer-grained recognized shapes per framework (e.g. NestJS GraphQL `@Resolver`/
`@Query`/`@Mutation`, Django CBV `.as_view()`, Drupal entity handlers) that
graphscout's simpler regexes don't all cover; verify with `--json` on a route-
heavy repo before relying on exhaustive coverage.

**Where graphscout still, honestly, trails — two real gaps, not sandbagged for
effect:**
- **Raw language count.** codegraph bundles its own tree-sitter extractor
  covering 30+ languages, including several graphify doesn't touch at all
  (ArkTS, Metal, CUDA, Liquid, Delphi, R, Luau, CFML, COBOL, VB.NET, Erlang,
  Solidity, Terraform, Nix). graphscout has no parser of its own — every
  language it indexes comes from the third-party `graphifyy` dependency, so
  this gap is structural: closing it means either `graphifyy` adding those
  grammars upstream, or graphscout vendoring its own tree-sitter grammars (a
  project on the scale of codegraph's own extractor, not a task for a small
  wrapper tool). Not being worked on for 0.7; noted here so the comparison
  stays honest rather than implying it's temporary.
- **Cross-language bridging** (Swift↔ObjC, React Native legacy/TurboModule
  bridges, Expo Modules, Fabric/Paper view managers). codegraph's version is
  validated against 15 real repos across small/medium/large per bridge type —
  a multi-month engineering effort with its own name-resolution heuristics per
  boundary. Deliberately **not attempted** here: a shallow same-named version
  built in an afternoon and marketed as parity would be a worse outcome than
  admitting the gap. If this matters for your use case, use codegraph.

Where graphscout is now ahead: **framework route parity** (17 named families,
closed in 0.6.1) plus **nine query types** (`diff`, `orphans`, `hotspots`,
`metrics`, `dupes`, `recent`, `why`, `tokens`, `viz --kind=imports`) that
aren't in codegraph's published tool list, at a fraction of the code size,
with zero telemetry and no bundled runtime. If you need 31-language coverage
or cross-language bridging, use codegraph. If you want a small, auditable,
telemetry-free tool that also answers "what actually changed", "what's dead",
"what should I refactor first", "how complex is this", "where's the
copy-paste", and "is it worth reading this whole function" — that's what
`graphscout` adds.

**On the benchmark gap:** codegraph's number (58% fewer tool calls, 22%
faster, near-zero file reads, median of 4 headless Claude runs across 7 real
repos, full methodology published) is real and rigorous. Matching it properly
means running many headless agent trials against cloned repos — real API
cost, not a code change — so it's scoped as a follow-up decision rather than
something spent silently; ask if you want a scaled-down version run.
